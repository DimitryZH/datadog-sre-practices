## 1. Accessing Trace Explorer

1. Navigate to **APM > Traces > Explorer** in the Datadog interface.
2. Close the introductory banner to maximize the workspace.
3. Filter by environment:
4. Observe the reporting services and live trace data.
5. Expand the **Requests, Errors, and Latency (RED)** section to see service summaries.

## 2. Exploring Service-Level RED Metrics

1. Go to **APM > Software Catalog > Services**.
2. Select the **discount** service and click **Service Page**.
3. Confirm:
- Metadata (language, type)
- Environment tag (`env:apm-getting-started`)
- Primary operation name (e.g., `flask.request`)
4. Set the time range to **Past 15 minutes**.

### RED Metrics
- **Requests & Errors**: Observe spikes in traffic or failure rates.
- **Latency**: Toggle between `p50`, `p75`, and `p90` to assess outliers.
- **Downstream Time**: See if latency is due to downstream services (e.g., `postgres`).

## 3. Endpoint-Level Metric Analysis

1. Scroll to the **Endpoints** section.
2. Focus on:
- `GET /discount`
- `GET /discount-code`
3. Use the legend to isolate the `GET /discount` data.
4. Click **Resource Page** for that endpoint.

### Endpoint Resource Page
- Confirm the primary operation (`flask.request`).
- Identify latency spikes.
- Click a spike to open the **Trace View** side panel.

## 4. Analyzing Traces in Detail

### Flame Graph
- Shows all spans for the trace.
- Top-level span (frontend service) shows entry point and full duration.
- Hover to view:
- Duration
- Service
- Operation name

###  Waterfall View
- Hierarchical timeline of spans.

###  Span List
- Table of all resources in the trace.
- Sort/filter by:
- Span count
- Duration
- Execution time
- Service

###  Map View
- Service dependency diagram.
- Shows percentage of execution time by service.
